# html-portfolio
Portfolio of projects reminding myself of the basics of html

The "main" branch in this repo holds the capstone project of my raw HTML web dev learning.

This is the section from [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) to help bolster FE dev skills.

Different branches in this section represent different projects undertaken in completion of the HTML part of this course.
