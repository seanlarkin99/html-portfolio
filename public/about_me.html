<p alt="About Seán larkin">
    My name is Seán Larkin. <br>
    Everything I do, I do to leave the world in a better place than I found it, for those I love and as many people as possible thereafter because I believe that that is our responsibility. <br>
    I am a highly entrepreneurial individual, with a huge range of interestes and passions. <br>
    I love personal growth and development. I am a big believer in constant improvement. <br>
    I have spent my entire life studying how the best leaders, athletes and business people do what they do, and am building a system to make it easier for people to get incredible results. <br>
    I'm fascinated by business. I love selling, finance, marketing, economics, tech dev, innovation, you name it. One of the most enjoyable things I do is to strategise different ways that entrepreneurs and business managers can grow their businesses and improve their processes. <br>
    Sport is my biggest past-time, watching and playing it. In particular I love football and F1, but I truly enjoy watching every sport I've seen. <br>
